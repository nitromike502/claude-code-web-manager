# Test Names with Hierarchical Numbers - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Complete!

All E2E test names now include hierarchical test numbers, making them visible in the Playwright UI.

## What Changed

Test names now include numbered prefixes that appear in Playwright's test output and UI.

### Format

```
[Suite Number]: [Suite Name] › [Test Number]: [Test Name]

Example:
100.001: E2E Integration: Complete User Flows › 100.001.001: user can navigate from dashboard to project
```
