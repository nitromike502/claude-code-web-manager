# E2E Tests - Phase 2 Migration Status

## Overview

The E2E tests in this directory were written for **Phase 1 architecture** (multi-page application with separate HTML files). **Phase 2 migrated to a Vue SPA** with Vue Router, Vite, and Pinia, making these tests incompatible.

## Architecture Changes (Phase 1 → Phase 2)

### Navigation
- **Phase 1:** Multi-page app with HTML files
  - Dashboard: `/index.html`
  - Project Detail: `/project-detail.html?id=projectId`
  - User View: `/user-view.html`
- **Phase 2:** Single-page app with Vue Router
  - Dashboard: `/`
  - Project Detail: `/project/:id`
  - User View: `/user`

### API Integration
- **Phase 1:** Direct fetch to backend on port 8420
- **Phase 2:** Vite dev server on port 5173 with proxy to backend

### Component Structure
- **Phase 1:** Vanilla JS with manual DOM manipulation
- **Phase 2:** Vue 3 Single File Components (.vue files)

### State Management
- **Phase 1:** Manual state management in localStorage
- **Phase 2:** Pinia stores (theme, projects, notifications)

## Test Status

### ❌ Skipped Tests (Phase 1 Architecture)

These tests are **skipped** because they require extensive rewriting for Phase 2:

1. **100-complete-user-flows-integration.spec.js** (24 tests)
   - Uses old URL patterns (`/project-detail.html?id=...`)
   - Expects file-based navigation instead of SPA routing
   - Mocks API routes that are now proxied through Vite

2. **101-user-flow-project-discovery.spec.js** (18 tests)
   - Same issues as above
   - Tests multi-page navigation patterns

3. **102-user-flow-configuration-viewing.spec.js** (27 tests)
   - Same issues as above
   - Tests configuration card interactions that changed in Phase 2

4. **105-user-flow-theme-toggle.spec.js** (21 tests)
   - Tests theme state management that moved to Pinia

### ⚠️ Responsive Tests (200-layout-responsive.spec.js) (9 failures)
- Partially compatible but needs selector updates
- Should be fixed to work with Phase 2 components

## Migration Path

To make these tests work with Phase 2, each test needs:

1. **URL Pattern Updates**
   ```javascript
   // OLD (Phase 1)
   await page.waitForURL(/project-detail\.html\?id=projectId/)

   // NEW (Phase 2)
   await page.waitForURL(/\/project\/projectId/)
   ```

2. **API Mocking Strategy**
   ```javascript
   // Tests should either:
   // A) Use the real backend API (on port 8420)
   // B) Mock at the network level before Vite proxy
   // C) Inject mock data into Pinia stores
   ```

3. **Selector Updates**
   ```javascript
   // OLD: Vanilla JS class names
   .project-card .project-name

   // NEW: Vue component structure
   // (mostly the same, but some differences)
   ```

4. **Navigation Updates**
   ```javascript
   // OLD: Check for page load
   await page.waitForURL('/project-detail.html')

   // NEW: Wait for Vue Router navigation
   await page.waitForURL(/\/project\//)
   ```

## Recommended Approach

**Option A: Comprehensive Rewrite (High Effort)**
- Rewrite all tests for Phase 2 architecture
- Estimated time: 8-12 hours
- Benefits: Full E2E coverage for Phase 2

**Option B: Focus on New Tests (Recommended)**
- Keep Phase 1 tests skipped with documentation
- Write new E2E tests specifically for Phase 2
- Use Playwright's component testing capabilities
- Estimated time: 4-6 hours for new test suite
- Benefits: Modern tests aligned with current architecture

**Option C: Hybrid Approach**
- Fix critical user flows only (e.g., dashboard → project detail)
- Skip less critical tests
- Estimated time: 2-4 hours
- Benefits: Basic E2E coverage with minimal effort

## Current Recommendation

**Keep tests skipped** until Phase 2 stabilizes. Focus testing efforts on:

1. **Backend Jest tests** - Already at 100% pass rate (270 tests)
2. **Frontend component tests** - Update for Vue components
3. **Manual testing** - Dashboard, project detail, user view

Once Phase 2 is fully stable (post-merge), dedicate a focused sprint to rewrite E2E tests using Option B (new test suite).

## Test Execution

To run E2E tests (will skip incompatible tests):

```bash
# Run all E2E tests (skipped tests will show as "skipped")
npm run test:frontend -- tests/e2e/

# Run specific test file
npm run test:frontend -- tests/e2e/102-user-flow-configuration-viewing.spec.js
```
