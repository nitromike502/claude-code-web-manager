# Project Status Check
# Claude Code Manager Development Assessment & Next Steps

<task>
Assess the current state of Claude Code Manager development, identify completed features and next steps from PRD documentation, then guide the user toward their next development objective.
</task>

<context>
**Project**: Claude Code Manager - Web-based tool for managing Claude Code projects
**Tech Stack**: Node.js + Express (backend), Vue 3 + PrimeVue (frontend, CDN)
**Architecture**: Local web server on port 8420, live file system reads

This command performs a comprehensive project assessment by:
1. Checking for core application files (package.json, src/backend/, src/frontend/)
2. Reviewing docs/PRD-Phase1-MVP.md for Phase 1 requirements
3. Checking docs/PRD-Phase2-*.md files for future planned features
4. Analyzing git status to identify work in progress
5. Determining Phase 1 MVP completion status
6. Presenting available next steps

**Development Context**: This project uses SWARM pattern for coordinated multi-agent development.

## Phase 1: Project State Assessment

**Step 1: Check Core Application Files**
Verify the existence and state of:
- `package.json` - Project dependencies and scripts
- `src/backend/` - Express server and API endpoints
- `src/frontend/` - Vue + PrimeVue UI components
- `docs/PRD-Phase1-MVP.md` - Phase 1 requirements
- `docs/Subagent-Team.md` - Team structure
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project overview

Use Read tool to verify these files exist and contain expected content.

**Step 2: Scan for Phase 2 Features**
Search `docs/` directory for Phase 2 PRD files:
- `docs/PRD-Phase2-Subagents.md` - Future subagent CRUD
- `docs/PRD-Phase2-Commands.md` - Future command CRUD
- `docs/PRD-Phase2-Hooks.md` - Future hooks CRUD
- `docs/PRD-Phase2-MCP.md` - Future MCP server CRUD
- These represent planned features (not yet reviewed)

Use Glob tool with pattern `docs/PRD-Phase2-*.md` to find all Phase 2 PRDs.

**Step 3: Analyze Development Status**
Check git status to identify:
- Modified files (work in progress)
- Current branch
- Recent commits to understand development timeline

Use Bash tool to run `git status` and `git log -5 --oneline`.

**Step 4: Determine Phase 1 MVP Status**
Assess whether Claude Code Manager Phase 1 MVP is complete by checking:
- Git repository initialized
- Wireframes created and approved
- Backend API endpoints implemented
- Frontend UI components built
- Integration complete and tested
- Dark mode implemented

Based on file existence and git history, determine current development phase.

## Phase 2: Present Status Summary

Provide a clear, actionable summary:

```
## Claude Code Manager - Project Status

### Current State
[Report on Phase 1 MVP completion status]
- ✅ Phase 0: [Status - Repository Setup]
- 🔄 Phase 1: [Status - Planning & Design]
- ⏳ Phase 2: [Status - Core Development]

### Phase 1 MVP Features (Read-Only Interface)
[Check completion of these features]

1. **Project Discovery** - Read from ~/.claude.json
2. **Subagent Viewing** - Display from .claude/agents/
3. **Slash Command Viewing** - Display from .claude/commands/
4. **Hooks Viewing** - Display from settings.json
5. **MCP Server Viewing** - Display from .mcp.json

### Phase 2 Features (Future - Not Yet Reviewed)

## What would you like to do next?

I can help you with:

**A) Start Phase 1 Development** (If not started)
   - Begin with wireframe design
   - Set up backend infrastructure
   - Build frontend components
   - Use `/swarm` command to coordinate development

**B) Continue Current Phase** (If in progress)
   - Resume where development left off
   - Complete current Epic/Story/Tasks
   - User review checkpoint after completion

**C) Run Full SWARM Orchestration**
   - Use `/swarm` command for complete multi-agent development
   - Subagent-orchestrator will coordinate specialized agents
   - Handles planning, development, code review, testing, and git workflow
   - Includes user review checkpoints

**D) Review & Documentation**
   - Code review of existing implementation
   - Generate technical documentation
   - Update PRD documents

**E) Phase 2 Planning** (After Phase 1 complete)
   - Review Phase 2 PRD documents
   - Plan CRUD operations for subagents/commands/hooks/MCP
   - Define Phase 2 Epic/Story/Task breakdown

**F) Custom Task**
   - Tell me what you'd like to work on
   - Can coordinate agents for any development need

Please choose an option (A-F) or describe what you'd like to accomplish.
```

## Phase 3: User Interaction

Wait for user response and:
- If they choose Start Phase 1 (A): Recommend using `/swarm` command to begin development
- If they choose Continue (B): Assess current state and resume from last completed task
- If they choose SWARM (C): Invoke `subagent-orchestrator` to coordinate development
- If they choose review/docs (D): Coordinate appropriate specialized agents
- If they choose Phase 2 planning (E): Guide through Phase 2 PRD review process
- If custom (F): Clarify requirements and suggest appropriate approach

**Important**: Keep the tone clear and actionable. This project demonstrates Claude Code's SWARM pattern with Epic/Story/Task breakdown and proper code review workflow.

## Execution Notes

1. **Parallel tool calls**: When checking multiple files, batch Read calls together for efficiency
2. **Graceful handling**: If expected files are missing, guide user to run `/swarm` to initialize
3. **Git awareness**: Check git status to understand current development state
4. **Phase awareness**: Clearly identify which phase is active
5. **Wireframes first**: If Phase 1 not started, emphasize wireframe creation as first step

## Success Criteria

- User understands current project state (which phase, what's complete)
- Next steps are clearly presented and actionable
- Available options align with current development phase
- User knows how to proceed with development
- Recommendations follow the approved SWARM workflow
