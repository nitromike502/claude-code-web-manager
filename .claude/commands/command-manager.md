# Claude Code Command Manager

I help you build and manage slash commands following Claude Code best practices. I'll collect all necessary information first, then implement your solution.

## Mode Selection

**Arguments:** `$ARGUMENTS`

**Choose your action:**

1. **Create New Command** (`new`)
   - I'll guide you through creating a new slash command
   - First, I need: command name, purpose, required tools, and functionality details

2. **Edit Existing Command** (`edit`)
   - I'll scan your existing commands and help you modify one
   - First, I need: which command to edit and what changes to make

3. **Interactive Help** (no arguments)
   - I'll help you decide and provide guidance

## Information Collection Process

**IMPORTANT:** I will NOT use the claude-code-expert subagent until I have collected ALL required information from you.

### For New Commands, I need:
- **Command name** and **description**
- **Required tools** (Bash, Read, Write, etc.)
- **Arguments** it should accept
- **Functionality** and expected behavior

### For Editing Commands, I need:
- **Which command** to modify (I'll scan and show available options)
- **What changes** you want to make
- **Scope** of modifications (bug fix, new features, refactoring)

## Implementation Flow

1. **Gather Requirements** - I collect all details directly
2. **Validate Completeness** - Ensure nothing is missing
3. **Expert Implementation** - Only then engage claude-code-expert subagent

**Let's start! Tell me:**
- Do you want to create a **new** command or **edit** an existing one?
- What's your specific goal?

I'll ask follow-up questions to collect complete requirements before proceeding to implementation.
