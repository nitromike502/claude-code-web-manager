# 🚀 Phase 2 Implementation - START HERE

**Status:** ✅ PLANNING COMPLETE - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
**Date:** 2025-10-18

This means:
- Phase 1 stays complete (✅)
- Phase 2 is NEW - technical migration (🔄 NEXT)
- Phases 2-5 all shift to Phases 3-6 (📋 PLANNED)

## 🎯 Phase 2 At a Glance

### What We're Building
Transform from:
```
❌ CDN Vue + Multiple HTML files + Manual routing
```

To:
```
✅ Vite SPA + Vue Router + Pinia stores + .vue components
```

### Why It Matters
- No page reloads (smooth SPA experience)
- Proper state management (Pinia)
- Vue DevTools integration (better debugging)
- HMR support (instant feedback < 1 sec)
- Foundation for all Phase 3+ features

### Scope
- **8 Stories** (independent work units)
- **40+ Tasks** (each 15-60 minutes max)
- **~12 hours** total development time
- **ZERO feature changes** - 100% Phase 1 parity

### Timeline
```
Recommend 3 sessions of 4-5 hours each:
Session 1: Vite setup + Vue Router (3.5h)
Session 2: Pinia + Components + API (4.5h)
Session 3: Styling + Testing + Docs (4.5h)

Or: Flexible schedule, one story per session
```

## 📋 The 8 Stories

| # | Story | Time | Focus |
|----|-------|------|-------|
| 2.1 | Vite Setup | 2h | Build system foundation |
| 2.2 | Vue Router | 1.5h | Client-side routing |
| 2.3 | Pinia | 1.5h | State management |
| 2.4 | Components | 3.5h | Convert to .vue files |
| 2.5 | API | 1.5h | Centralize API calls |
| 2.6 | Styling | 1.5h | CSS organization |
| 2.7 | Testing | 2h | Validation & QA |
| 2.8 | Docs | 1h | Documentation |

**Longest:** Story 2.4 (3.5h) - Component conversion

## 🔄 Workflow Overview

### For Each Story
1. **Create** feature branch from `phase-2`
2. **Implement** all tasks (with git commits after each)
3. **Test** manually + run automated tests
4. **Create** PR targeting `phase-2` branch
5. **Merge** after code review (→ `phase-2`)
6. **Repeat** for next story

### Branch Strategy
```
phase-2 (base) ← All Phase 2 work goes here
├── feature/vite-setup
├── feature/vue-router
├── feature/pinia-stores
├── feature/component-conversion
├── feature/api-integration
├── feature/styling-css
├── feature/testing-validation
└── feature/documentation

After complete: phase-2 → main (fast-forward)
```

## ⏱️ Quick Time Breakdown

```
Reading & Planning:          1-2 hours
Implementation (8 stories):  ~12 hours
Testing & Fixes:             2-3 hours
Code Review & Merge:         1-2 hours
─────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL Phase 2:               16-19 hours
```

**Spread across 3-5 development sessions**

---

## 🛑 Critical Reminders

1. **One commit per task** - Track progress in git history
2. **Test after each task** - Manual tests before automated
3. **All tests must pass** - Mandatory quality gate before PR
4. **One PR per story** - Not multiple stories in one PR
5. **Target is `phase-2`** - NOT `main` during Phase 2
6. **Fast-forward merge after** - phase-2 → main after complete

---

## 📈 Expected Outcomes

After Phase 2 Complete:

**Developer Experience**
- ✅ `npm run dev` - Instant startup
- ✅ HMR - File edit → refresh < 1 second
- ✅ Vue DevTools - Full integration
- ✅ Error messages - Clear & descriptive

**Performance**
- ✅ Bundle - < 500KB gzipped
- ✅ Load time - < 2 seconds initial
- ✅ Navigation - Instant (no reloads)

**Quality**
- ✅ Tests - 100% pass rate
- ✅ Browser - Chrome, Firefox, Safari all work
- ✅ Code - Clean, reviewed, documented
- ✅ Features - 100% Phase 1 parity

---

## 🎯 Next Action

**Run the orchestrator:**

```bash
/swarm
```

The orchestrator will:
1. Scan for Phase 2 tickets (they exist!)
2. Present implementation options
3. Coordinate development workflow
4. Run automated tests (mandatory)
5. Create PRs and track progress

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Will Phase 1 functionality change?**
A: No! Phase 2 is 100% technical migration. All Phase 1 features work identically.

**Q: Can I work on multiple stories at once?**
A: Yes! Stories are independent. Backend + Frontend can work on separate stories in parallel.

**Q: What if tests fail?**
A: Fix the issues and re-run. No PR can merge with failing tests (mandatory quality gate).

**Q: How long will Phase 2 take?**
A: ~12 hours development time, spread across 3-5 sessions depending on team.

**Q: What comes after Phase 2?**
A: Phase 3 (Subagent Edit Features) - built on solid Vite SPA foundation!
