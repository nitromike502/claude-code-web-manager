## Root Cause Analysis

### Category 1: Missing Mock Data (8 tests affected)
- **Problem:** Test projects didn't exist in centralized mock fixture
- **Symptoms:** Tests timeout waiting for elements that never load
- **Solution:** Added 8 new projects to `tests/fixtures/mock-data.js`
- **Projects Added:** statsproject, mobileproject, tabletproject, desktopproject, consoletestproject, navtest, warningproject, anyproject
- **Tests Fixed:** 02.001.005, 02.003.001, 02.007.001-003, 02.008.001

### Category 2: Incomplete Route Handlers (4 tests affected)
- **Problem:** API endpoints not properly mocked for error scenarios
- **Symptoms:** Tests expecting error states receive different responses
- **Solution:** Added complete route handler setup with proper response structure
- **Tests Fixed:** 02.005.001, 02.005.003, 02.005.004, 02.005.006

### Category 3: Phase 1→2 Selector Updates (4 tests affected)
- **Problem:** Selectors written for Phase 1 HTML don't work in Phase 2 SPA
- **Symptoms:** Initial selector worked, but failed Playwright strict mode (resolved to 2 elements)
- **Solution:** Narrowed selector to specific element (`.dashboard-header h2`)
- **Tests Fixed:** 200.001.001, 200.002.001, 200.003.001, (+ related functionality)

## Technical Patterns Established

### 1. Centralized Mock Data Pattern
```javascript
// All tests now use this approach:
const { setupMocks } = require('../../fixtures/mock-setup.js');
await setupMocks(page);  // Loads all mock data and base routes
await page.goto('/projects/projectid');
```

### 2. Mock Data Structure
```javascript
// Every project must exist in BOTH locations:
mockProjects: [{ id, name, path, stats }]
mockProjectDetails: { projectid: { agents, commands, hooks, mcp } }
```

### 3. Error Route Handling
```javascript
// Specific error routes BEFORE generic mocks:
await page.route('**/api/specific', (route) => { /* error */ });
await setupMocks(page);  // Generic routes
```

### 4. Playwright Strict Mode
```javascript
// Selectors must resolve to exactly one element:
page.locator('.dashboard-header h2')  // ✅ Good (1 element)
page.locator('.header h2, .title h2')  // ❌ Bad (2+ elements)
```

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Visual Regression Tests (Low Priority)
- **Status:** 19 tests intentionally skipped
- **Reason:** Written for Phase 1, need Phase 2 update
- **Action:** Keep skipped until Phase 3 planning
- **Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours when needed
- **Documentation:** See VISUAL-REGRESSION-TESTS-STATUS.md

### Performance Testing
- **Status:** Not implemented
- **Priority:** Low (Phase 3+ consideration)
- **Use Case:** Measure build times, page load times, test runtime

### E2E Test Expansion
- **Status:** Current E2E tests cover core workflows
- **Gaps:** Some edge cases not covered
- **Priority:** Medium (Phase 3+ consideration)

---

## Dependencies & Environment

### Required
- Node.js 18.0.0+
- npm (with playwright)
- Express backend running on port 8420
- Vite frontend running on port 5173 (dev mode)

### Test Execution Commands
```bash
# All tests
npm run test:frontend

# Specific file
npm run test:frontend -- tests/frontend/02-project-detail.spec.js

# With grep filter
npm run test:frontend -- -g "02.001.005"

# Watch mode
npm run test:frontend -- --watch

# Update visual baselines (if enabled)
npm run test:frontend -- --update-snapshots
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Next Steps)
1. ✅ All tests passing - ready for deployment
2. ✅ Documentation complete
3. ⏳ Consider running full test suite one more time before merge

### Short-term (This Week)
1. Monitor production deployment
2. Gather feedback on test stability
3. Plan Phase 3 features (if applicable)

### Medium-term (This Month)
1. Evaluate visual regression test strategy
2. Consider performance testing implementation
3. Plan additional E2E scenarios if needed

### Long-term (Future)
1. Recreate visual regression tests for Phase 2
2. Implement performance testing
3. Add visual regression baselines
4. Expand E2E coverage as features are added
