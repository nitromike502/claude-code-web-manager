## SWARM Workflow with Git Integration

### Git Workflow Rules

**Branch Structure:**
- `main` - Production-ready code (protected, PR required)
- `develop` - Integration branch for active development (protected, PR required)
- `feature/*` - Feature branches (developers commit directly)
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fix branches
- `docs/*` - Documentation updates

**Branch Naming Convention:**
- Only alphanumeric characters, dashes, and underscores
- Format: `feature/epic1-story2-task3-description`
- Example: `feature/e1-s2-t3-backend-api-projects`

**Commit Workflow:**
1. Developers commit directly to their feature branches regularly (at least daily)
2. Meaningful commit messages using conventional format: `type: description`
3. Run tests before creating PR
4. When ready for review, create PR to `develop` branch
5. code-reviewer reviews PR and either approves or requests changes
6. If changes requested, developer commits to same branch (PR updates automatically)
7. Once approved, git-workflow-specialist squash-merges PR
8. Feature branch deleted after merge

**Stale Branch Monitoring:**
- At start of each development session, git-workflow-specialist reports branches without PRs
- Helps identify abandoned or forgotten work

**PR Guidelines:**
- Create PR only when ready for review (not draft PRs)
- Keep PRs focused (< 500 lines ideal)
- Include: Epic/Story/Task reference, description, testing notes, screenshots (if UI)
- Squash-merge keeps clean history

**Merge Conflict Prevention:**
- Git-workflow-specialist regularly updates long-running branches from develop
- Before creating PR, ensure branch is up-to-date
- If conflicts during review, developer rebases and force-pushes to feature branch

## Development Best Practices

### Commit Frequency
- **Minimum:** Daily commits for active work
- **Recommended:** Multiple commits per day
- **Developers commit directly to their feature branches**
- **Commit when:**
  - Completing a logical unit of work
  - Before switching tasks
  - Before end of day
  - When a feature is working

### Commit Message Format
```
type: brief description

Optional longer explanation of what changed and why

References: Epic X, Story Y, Task Z
```

**Types:** feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

**Examples:**
- `feat: implement project discovery from ~/.claude.json`
- `fix: handle missing YAML frontmatter in subagent files`
- `docs: add API endpoint documentation`

### PR Guidelines
- **When to create:** Only when work is ready for review (tests passing)
- **Target branch:** Always PR to `develop`
- **Size:** Keep PRs focused and reviewable (< 500 lines ideal)
- **Title:** Clear, descriptive (e.g., "Add project discovery API endpoint")
- **Description must include:**
  - Epic/Story/Task reference
  - What changed and why
  - How to test the changes
  - Screenshots (for UI changes)
  - Any known issues or follow-ups
- **Review time:** Code reviewer reviews within 24 hours
- **Approval required:** Must have code-reviewer approval to merge

### Code Review Process
1. Developer creates PR to `develop` when ready
2. code-reviewer reviews PR on GitHub within 24 hours
3. If changes requested:
   - Developer commits fixes to same feature branch
   - PR updates automatically
   - Developer notifies code-reviewer for re-review
4. Once approved by code-reviewer:
   - git-workflow-specialist squash-merges PR to `develop`
   - git-workflow-specialist deletes feature branch
5. integration-tester validates merged changes on `develop`

### Stale Branch Monitoring
- At start of each development session:
  - git-workflow-specialist lists all feature branches
  - Reports branches without associated PRs
  - Helps identify forgotten or abandoned work

### Communication
- **Daily stand-ups:** Coordinated by subagent-orchestrator
- **Blocker escalation:** Immediate notification to orchestrator
- **PR notifications:** Tag code-reviewer when PR created
- **Bug reports:** Create as issues, tag relevant developers
- **Re-review requests:** Notify code-reviewer when PR updated

## Agent Creation

To create these agents in `.claude/agents/`:

```bash
# Development Team
1. backend-architect.md
2. frontend-developer.md
3. data-parser.md
4. wireframe-designer.md

# Quality Assurance Team
5. integration-tester.md
6. code-reviewer.md

# Coordination Team
7. git-workflow-specialist.md
8. subagent-orchestrator.md
9. project-manager.md
```

Each agent file should contain:
- YAML frontmatter with name, description, tools
- Detailed system prompt from this document
- Context about the project from CLAUDE.md and PRD-Phase1-MVP.md
- Git workflow expectations
- Code review expectations
