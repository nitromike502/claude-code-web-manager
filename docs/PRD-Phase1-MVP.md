# Product Requirements Document: Claude Code Manager - Phase 1 (MVP)

**Version:** 1.0
**Phase:** 1 - MVP (View-Only Navigation Interface)
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-06
**Status:** Draft - Ready for Review

---

## 1. Project Overview

**Project Name:** Claude Code Manager
**Phase 1 Goal:** Create a web-based interface to discover, navigate, and view Claude Code projects and their configurations (subagents, slash commands, hooks, and MCP servers).

**Deployment Model:**
- Local web server (Node.js + Express)
- Access via web browser at `http://localhost:8420`
- Runs on any machine with Node.js installed
- Cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux)

**Tech Stack:**
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Frontend: Vue 3 + PrimeVue (CDN-hosted) for UI components
- Data Model: Live file system reads (no database)
- Authentication: None (local-only tool)

**Phase 1 Scope:** Read-only viewing interface. No editing, creation, or deletion capabilities.

---

## 2. Core Features (Phase 1 MVP)

### 2.1 Project Discovery

**Objective:** Automatically discover and list all Claude Code projects on the machine.

**Requirements:**
- Read project list from `~/.claude.json` (maintained by Claude Code)
- Parse JSON file to extract project paths from the `projects` object (paths are used as keys)
- Display discovered projects in a list/card view
- Show basic project information:
  - Project name (derived from directory name of the path)
  - Full file path
  - Count of agents/commands/hooks/MCP servers found (calculated by scanning each project)
- Manual rescan button to refresh project list (re-read `~/.claude.json`)
- Validate that project directories still exist
- Handle missing or invalid project paths gracefully

**UI Considerations:**
- Clean, simple project list
- Quick navigation to project details
- Visual indication of project status (valid/missing)
- Search/filter projects by name or path

**Status:** 📝 Ready for Review

## 4. Technical Architecture (Phase 1)

### 4.1 Backend Requirements

**Core Functionality:**
- Read project list from `~/.claude.json`
- Directory scanning within known projects for subagents/commands/hooks/MCP servers
- Markdown parser with YAML frontmatter support
- JSON parser for settings files
- REST API endpoints (read-only)

**API Endpoints:**
```
GET  /api/projects                              - List all projects
GET  /api/projects/:projectId/agents            - Get project subagents
GET  /api/projects/:projectId/commands          - Get project commands
GET  /api/projects/:projectId/hooks             - Get project hooks
GET  /api/projects/:projectId/mcp               - Get project MCP servers
GET  /api/user/agents                           - Get user subagents
GET  /api/user/commands                         - Get user commands
GET  /api/user/hooks                            - Get user hooks
GET  /api/user/mcp                              - Get user MCP servers
POST /api/projects/scan                         - Trigger project rescan
```

**Note:** projectId will be the project path with slashes removed (e.g., `/home/user/projects/myapp` becomes `homeuserprojectsmyapp`)

**Error Handling:**
- Graceful handling of missing files
- Parsing errors for malformed JSON/YAML
- Permission errors
- Return meaningful error messages to frontend
