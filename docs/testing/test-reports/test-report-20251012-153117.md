| # | Test Name | Status | Duration |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|

| 7 | should filter out failed parses in parseAllSubagents | ✅ PASS | 2 ms |
| 8 | should handle missing YAML frontmatter gracefully | ✅ PASS | 2 ms |
| 9 | should handle completely empty agent file | ✅ PASS | 2 ms |
| 10 | should still parse valid agents correctly (no regression) | ✅ PASS | 3 ms |

**Total:** 10 passed, 0 failed

## Bug Context

### BUG-001 Details

- **Bug ID:** BUG-001
- **Discovered:** 2025-10-10
- **Fixed:** PR #10 (commit 6f4dc83)
- **Severity:** Critical (Server Crash)

**Original Symptom:**
- Server crashed with 500 error when parsing agent file with malformed YAML frontmatter
- Entire `/api/projects/:projectId/agents` endpoint failed
- No error handling for YAML parsing failures

**Root Cause:**
- gray-matter library throws exceptions on invalid YAML
- No try-catch wrapper around YAML parsing in `parseSubagent()`
- One malformed file caused entire directory parse to fail

**Fix Applied:**
- Wrapped YAML parsing in try-catch block in `parseSubagent()`
- Returns null for failed parses (filtered out later)
- Logs error to console for debugging
- Other valid agents in directory continue to parse successfully

## Test Coverage

### Original Bug Scenario (TEST 1)
✅ Reproduces exact crash scenario (unclosed YAML bracket)
✅ Verifies parser returns null instead of crashing
✅ Confirms exception is caught and handled gracefully

### Directory Resilience (TEST 2, 7)
✅ Verifies valid agents still parse when malformed ones exist
✅ Confirms `parseAllSubagents()` filters out null results
✅ Ensures at least one valid agent is returned

### Multiple YAML Error Types (TESTS 3-6)
✅ Unclosed bracket in YAML array
✅ Missing colon in YAML frontmatter
✅ Unclosed bracket in YAML object
✅ Incomplete YAML key without value

### Edge Cases (TESTS 8-9)
✅ Missing YAML frontmatter (markdown only)
✅ Completely empty agent file

### No Regression (TEST 10)
✅ Valid agents still parse correctly
✅ All expected fields present
✅ Fix doesn't break normal parsing

## Test Fixtures Used

| Fixture | Purpose | Location |
|---------|---------|----------|
| `invalid-yaml.md` | Malformed YAML (unclosed brackets) | `/home/claude/manager/tests/fixtures/samples/agents/` |
| `malformed-agent.md` | Malformed YAML (missing closing bracket) | `/home/claude/manager/tests/fixtures/projects/valid-project/.claude/agents/` |
| `valid-complete.md` | Valid agent with all fields | `/home/claude/manager/tests/fixtures/samples/agents/` |
| `empty.md` | Empty file | `/home/claude/manager/tests/fixtures/samples/agents/` |
| `missing-frontmatter.md` | No YAML frontmatter | `/home/claude/manager/tests/fixtures/samples/agents/` |

---

## Code Quality

### Test Documentation
- Comprehensive JSDoc comments explaining each test
- Bug history and context documented in file header
- Inline comments explaining expected behavior
- Clear test names describing what is being verified

### Test Structure
- Follows Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- One assertion per test (where appropriate)
- Descriptive expectations with clear failure messages
- Tests isolated and independent

### Test Strategy
- Unit tests targeting `parseSubagent()` and `parseAllSubagents()` directly
- No API endpoint dependencies (faster execution)
- Uses existing test fixtures (no new fixtures needed)
- Focused on preventing regression of critical bug

---

## Console Output

The test suite generates expected error logs from the parser:

```
console.error
  Error parsing subagent /home/claude/manager/tests/fixtures/samples/agents/invalid-yaml.md:
  missed comma between flow collection entries at line 4, column 1:
      tools: {malformed
      ^
```

These error logs are **expected and correct** - they demonstrate that:
1. The parser catches YAML errors
2. Error messages are descriptive
3. The parser continues processing instead of crashing

## Test Execution Commands

### Run BUG-001 Tests Only
```bash
npm test -- tests/backend/regression/bug-001-yaml.test.js
```

### Run All Regression Tests
```bash
npm test -- tests/backend/regression/
```

### Run All Backend Tests
```bash
npm test tests/backend/
```

---

## Recommendations

### Test Maintenance
1. ✅ Run these regression tests before any changes to `subagentParser.js`
2. ✅ Add similar regression tests for BUG-002 (hooks parser)
3. ✅ Consider adding regression tests for BUG-003+ as bugs are discovered

### Continuous Integration
1. ✅ Include regression tests in CI pipeline
2. ✅ Make regression test failures block PRs
3. ✅ Run regression suite before every release

### Future Enhancements
1. Add integration tests for API endpoint warning system
2. Add visual regression tests for frontend warning display
3. Add performance tests for large directories with mixed valid/invalid files

## Conclusion

✅ **TEST SUITE READY FOR PRODUCTION**

The BUG-001 regression test suite successfully validates the fix and prevents future regressions. All 10 tests pass with comprehensive coverage of:
- Original crash scenario
- Multiple YAML error types
- Edge cases
- Normal parsing validation

**Status:** APPROVED FOR MERGE

**Next Steps:**
1. Commit test file to feature branch ✅ (COMPLETE)
2. Run full test suite before PR creation
3. Include test report in PR description
