**Time:** 20:07:46 UTC
**Branch:** test/ticket-3-hooks
**Test File:** tests/backend/endpoints/project-hooks.test.js
**Ticket:** Ticket 3 - Hooks Feature (Task 3.1 + 3.2)

---

## Summary

✅ **ALL TESTS PASSED**

- **Total Tests:** 33
- **Passed:** 33
- **Failed:** 0
- **Duration:** 1.135 seconds

---

## Test Coverage Breakdown

### 1. Happy Path Tests (7 tests)
✅ should return 200 and hooks array for valid project
✅ should include projectId and projectPath in response
✅ should parse hooks from settings.json with correct structure
✅ should parse pre-commit hooks correctly
✅ should parse pre-push hooks correctly
✅ should return empty array for project without hooks
✅ should include hook event types

**Key Validations:**
- Response structure: `{success, hooks, warnings, projectId, projectPath}`
- Hook object structure: `{event, matcher, hooks, source, matcherIndex}`
- Hook commands: `{type, command, enabled}`
- Empty hooks handling for minimal projects

---

### 2. Merge Logic Tests (6 tests)
✅ should merge hooks from settings.json and settings.local.json
✅ should include post-checkout hook from settings.local.json
✅ should preserve separate hooks for different events
✅ should handle matcher patterns correctly
✅ should handle multiple matchers in same event

**Key Validations:**
- Hooks from both settings.json and settings.local.json are merged
- Local hooks are properly identified with source attribution
- Different events maintain separate identities
- Matcher patterns (*.js, *) are preserved correctly
- Multiple matchers per event are supported

---

### 3. Error Handling Tests (5 tests)
✅ should return 404 for invalid project ID
✅ should return 404 for empty project ID
✅ should generate warnings for malformed settings.json
✅ should return empty hooks array for malformed settings
✅ should handle missing .claude directory gracefully

**Key Validations:**
- Invalid project IDs return 404 with error message
- Malformed JSON generates warnings but doesn't crash
- Missing directories return empty arrays (no errors)
- Resilient error handling throughout

---

### 4. Response Structure Tests (4 tests)
✅ should return correct response structure
✅ each hook should have required fields
✅ each hook command should have correct structure
✅ each warning should have required fields

**Key Validations:**
- Response has all required top-level fields
- Each hook has: event, matcher, hooks, source, matcherIndex
- Each hook command has: type, command
- Each warning has: file, error, skipped

---

### 5. Hook Event Types (4 tests)
✅ should support pre-commit events
✅ should support pre-push events
✅ should support post-checkout events
✅ should support post-merge events

**Key Validations:**
- All standard Git hook events are supported
- Events are correctly parsed from settings files
- Multiple hooks per event type work correctly

---

### 6. Edge Cases (4 tests)
✅ should handle empty hooks object gracefully
✅ should return consistent results on multiple requests
✅ should handle special characters in project path
✅ should handle settings.json without hooks field

**Key Validations:**
- Empty objects/arrays handled gracefully
- Results are deterministic (no caching issues)
- Special characters in paths work correctly
- Missing hooks field doesn't cause errors

---

### 7. Integration with Project Discovery (2 tests)
✅ should work after project scan
✅ should load projects cache if not already loaded

**Key Validations:**
- Endpoint works after POST /api/projects/scan
- Automatic cache loading when needed
- No dependency on prior scan for basic functionality

---

### 8. Source Attribution (2 tests)
✅ hooks should correctly identify their source file
✅ should distinguish between project and local hooks

**Key Validations:**
- Each hook has correct source: 'settings.json' or 'settings.local.json'
- Project-level and local-level hooks are distinguishable
- Source attribution helps debugging and understanding hook origin

---

## Test Fixtures Used

### Valid Project
**Path:** `/home/claude/manager/tests/fixtures/projects/valid-project`

**Files:**
- `.claude/settings.json` - Contains pre-commit (*.js) and pre-push (*) hooks
- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Contains post-checkout (*) hook

**Hook Events:**
- pre-commit: npm run lint (matcher: *.js)
- pre-push: npm test (matcher: *)
- post-checkout: npm install (matcher: *)

### Minimal Project
**Path:** `/home/claude/manager/tests/fixtures/projects/minimal-project`

**Files:**
- `.claude/settings.json` - Empty object `{}`

**Hook Events:** None (used to test empty hooks handling)

### Malformed Project
**Path:** `/home/claude/manager/tests/fixtures/projects/malformed-project`

**Files:**
- `.claude/settings.json` - Invalid JSON (missing comma on line 6)

**Expected Behavior:**
- Generates warnings
- Returns empty hooks array
- Does not crash

---

## Key Features Tested

### 1. Hook Structure
Each hook entry contains:
```json
{
  "event": "pre-commit",
  "matcher": "*.js",
  "hooks": [
    {
      "type": "command",
      "command": "npm run lint",
      "enabled": true
    }
  ],
  "source": "settings.json",
  "matcherIndex": 0
}
```

### 2. Merge Logic
- **Project hooks** (settings.json) + **Local hooks** (settings.local.json)
- Both sources preserved with source attribution
- Hooks remain independent (no overwriting, just merging)

### 3. Error Handling
- Malformed JSON → warnings, empty array, 200 response
- Invalid project ID → 404 response
- Missing files → empty array, no warnings
- Resilient parsing continues despite individual file errors

### 4. Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "hooks": [...],
  "warnings": [...],
  "projectId": "homeclaudemanagertestsfixturesprojectsvalid-project",
  "projectPath": "/home/claude/manager/tests/fixtures/projects/valid-project"
}
```

## Full Test Suite Results

Running `npm test` executes all backend tests:

**Total Test Suites:** 18 passed
**Total Tests:** 194 passed
**Time:** ~3 seconds

All existing tests continue to pass with the new hooks endpoint tests added.

## Test Quality Metrics

### Coverage
- ✅ Happy path scenarios
- ✅ Merge logic (settings.json + settings.local.json)
- ✅ All hook event types (pre-commit, pre-push, post-checkout, post-merge)
- ✅ Error handling (malformed JSON, invalid IDs, missing files)
- ✅ Edge cases (empty objects, special characters, caching)
- ✅ Integration with project discovery
- ✅ Source attribution

### Test Design
- **Descriptive names:** Each test clearly states what is being tested
- **Focused assertions:** Tests validate specific behaviors
- **Fixture reuse:** Leverages existing test fixtures consistently
- **Resilient:** Tests handle both success and failure scenarios
- **Fast:** All 33 tests run in ~1.1 seconds

### Maintainability
- **Clear structure:** Tests organized into logical describe blocks
- **Helper functions:** createProjectId helper used consistently
- **Well-commented:** File header explains test coverage and fixtures
- **Type checking:** Validates response structure and data types

---

## Code Quality

### Backend Implementation
**File:** `/home/claude/manager/src/backend/services/projectDiscovery.js`

**Key Functions:**
- `getProjectHooks(projectPath)` - Reads and merges settings files
- Handles both array format and object format for hooks
- Type-safe parsing with explicit checks before .map() calls
- Resilient error handling with warnings system

**Response Structure:**
```javascript
return { hooks, warnings };
```

### API Endpoint
**File:** `/home/claude/manager/src/backend/routes/projects.js`

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/projects/:projectId/hooks`

**Features:**
- Validates project ID exists in cache
- Loads project cache if needed
- Returns structured response with hooks, warnings, and metadata

---

## Regression Prevention

These tests serve as regression prevention for:
- **BUG-002:** Hooks parser error handling (already fixed)
- Future changes to hooks parsing logic
- Changes to settings file structure
- API endpoint modifications

All tests are automated and run on every commit to prevent regressions.

---

## Action Items

None - All tests passing!

---

## Conclusion

**Status:** ✅ READY FOR PR CREATION

The GET /api/projects/:id/hooks endpoint is fully tested with comprehensive coverage of:
- Happy path scenarios
- Merge logic for project and local settings
- Error handling for malformed files
- All standard Git hook event types
- Edge cases and integration scenarios

All 33 tests pass consistently, and the full test suite (194 tests) continues to pass.

**Next Steps:**
1. Push branch to remote
2. Create pull request
3. Code review
4. Merge to main
