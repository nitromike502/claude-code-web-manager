**Date:** 2025-10-12 20:07:50 UTC
**Branch:** `test/ticket-3-hooks`
**Task:** Task 3.6 - Create hooks-specific error handling tests for malformed JSON
**Test File:** `/home/claude/manager/tests/backend/errors/malformed-json.test.js`

---

## Executive Summary

✅ **ALL TESTS PASSED** (22/22 tests)

Successfully created and executed comprehensive malformed JSON error handling tests for the hooks and MCP parsing systems. All tests validate that the backend gracefully handles malformed JSON files without crashing and provides descriptive warnings.

## Test Coverage

### Features Tested

1. **Parser Resilience**
   - Malformed JSON in settings.json does not crash server ✅
   - Malformed JSON in settings.local.json does not crash server ✅
   - Malformed JSON in .mcp.json does not crash server ✅
   - User-level settings with malformed JSON handled gracefully ✅

2. **Warning System**
   - Warning messages include absolute file paths ✅
   - Warning messages include descriptive error details ✅
   - Warnings mention "JSON", "parse", "invalid", or "syntax" ✅
   - Each warning has required structure (file, error, skipped) ✅

3. **Continued Processing**
   - System returns empty arrays when JSON is malformed ✅
   - System continues if one settings file fails but another succeeds ✅
   - No crashes or uncaught exceptions ✅

4. **Error Message Quality**
   - Error messages are actionable and specific ✅
   - Error messages identify the JSON syntax issue ✅
   - File paths are absolute and complete ✅

5. **Edge Cases**
   - Missing files handled gracefully (no warnings) ✅
   - Non-existent directories handled gracefully ✅
   - Common JSON errors (trailing commas) detected ✅

### Test Fixtures Used

- `/home/claude/manager/tests/fixtures/projects/malformed-project/` - Project with invalid JSON
- `/home/claude/manager/tests/fixtures/projects/valid-project/` - Project with valid configs
- `/home/claude/manager/tests/fixtures/projects/minimal-project/` - Empty project (baseline)
- `/home/claude/manager/tests/fixtures/samples/settings/invalid-json.json` - Malformed JSON sample

## Code Quality Metrics

### Test Quality
- **Descriptive Test Names:** All test names clearly state what is being tested
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Tests cover success paths, error paths, and edge cases
- **Consistent Structure:** Follows existing test patterns from malformed-yaml.test.js
- **Assertions:** Multiple assertions per test to verify behavior thoroughly
- **Isolation:** Tests are independent and can run in any order

### Error Handling Validation
- ✅ JSON syntax errors caught and reported
- ✅ File paths validated as absolute
- ✅ Warning structure validated (file, error, skipped fields)
- ✅ No crashes or uncaught exceptions
- ✅ Graceful degradation when files missing

---

## Notes

- Console warnings during test execution are **expected behavior** - they validate that error logging works correctly
- Tests use existing test fixtures from `/home/claude/manager/tests/fixtures/`
- Test patterns follow established conventions from `malformed-yaml.test.js`
- All tests run fast (< 50ms each) for quick feedback cycles
- Tests validate both project-level and user-level configuration parsing
