## Phase 2 Completion Status

### ‚úÖ All Critical Bugs Resolved (October 24, 2025)
- **BUG-027** - Agent color display in sidebar ‚úÖ FIXED
- **BUG-028** - Agent model display in sidebar ‚úÖ FIXED
- **BUG-029** - Agent tools display in sidebar ‚úÖ FIXED
- **BUG-035** - User configuration card persistence after navigation ‚úÖ FIXED

### ‚úÖ Additional Improvements
- Agent metadata now complete with color, model, and tools
- User configuration card persists correctly across navigation
- Sidebar width consistency (75vw) across all components
- Test coverage increased from 311 to 313 tests (100% pass rate)

### ‚è≥ Remaining Bugs (Lower Priority - Optional)
1. **BUG-030** - Command tools display in sidebar
2. **BUG-031** - Command argument hint display in sidebar
3. **BUG-032** - Hook command display in sidebar
4. **BUG-033** - Hook type display in sidebar

**Note:** These bugs are cosmetic improvements to command and hook sidebars. Agent metadata is now complete.

## Phase 3: Subagent CRUD Operations (Planned Next)

**Status:** PROPOSED | Ready for planning
**Estimated Scope:** Medium (3-4 weeks)

### Phase 3 Goals
1. **Create New Subagents** - UI form to create `.claude/agents/*.md` files
2. **Edit Existing Subagents** - In-place editing with live preview
3. **Delete Subagents** - With confirmation and safety checks
4. **YAML Validation** - Frontmatter validation with helpful error messages
5. **Live Preview** - Show rendered agent content while editing

### Phase 3 Architecture
- **Frontend:** Modal forms for create/edit, confirmation dialogs for delete
- **Backend:** File write operations with validation and error handling
- **API Endpoints:** POST/PUT/DELETE operations on `/api/projects/:projectId/agents`
- **Testing:** New tests for CRUD operations with validation

### Phase 3 Implementation Order
1. Create agent form (UI)
2. POST endpoint to create agent files
3. Edit agent form (UI)
4. PUT endpoint to update agent files
5. Delete confirmation dialog (UI)
6. DELETE endpoint with safety checks
7. YAML frontmatter validation
8. Live preview functionality
9. Comprehensive testing
10. Documentation and release

### Phase 3 Success Criteria
- [ ] Create new agents with YAML validation
- [ ] Edit existing agents with live preview
- [ ] Delete agents with confirmation
- [ ] Error handling for malformed YAML
- [ ] All CRUD tests passing (50+ new tests)
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified
- [ ] Zero console errors during CRUD operations

## Optional Remaining Bugs (Post Phase-2)

The following bugs represent cosmetic improvements to command and hook sidebars:

| Bug | Field | Component | Priority |
|-----|-------|-----------|----------|
| BUG-030 | `tools` | Command sidebar | Low |
| BUG-031 | `argumentHint` | Command sidebar | Low |
| BUG-032 | `command` | Hook sidebar | Low |
| BUG-033 | `type` | Hook sidebar | Low |

**Implementation Process (if prioritized):**
1. Add field display line(s) to ProjectDetail.vue
2. Add field display line(s) to UserGlobal.vue
3. Test manually on port 5173
4. Get user approval
5. Create Playwright tests
6. Update documentation
7. Commit with reference to bug ticket

**Recommendation:** Consider these after Phase 3 (CRUD) is implemented, as CRUD operations are more valuable to users than additional metadata display.

## Key Insights from BUG-027

### What Worked Well
- Sequential bug-by-bug approach with user testing between each
- Minimal code changes (usually 1-2 lines per bug)
- Tests created AFTER user approval ensures 100% pass rate
- Documentation updated BEFORE commits keeps record current

### Development Server Tips
- **Always use port 5173** (Vite dev server) for testing, NOT port 8420
- Port 5173 serves live source code with Hot Module Replacement
- Port 8420 serves stale production build (`/dist` directory)
- Only rebuild `/dist` when deploying to production

### Testing Tips
- Run Playwright tests with `--project=chromium` flag only (faster than multi-browser)
- Run single test file only: `npx playwright test tests/frontend/04-component-rendering.spec.js`
- Use flexible CSS selectors: `.sidebar-section p` with `hasText` filter instead of text-based selectors
- Tests should verify field displays AND handle missing values gracefully

### Documentation Tips
- Update all affected documentation BEFORE committing code
- Files to update for each bug:
  1. Bug ticket (mark as resolved)
  2. EPIC-003 (update progress and next bug)
  3. NEXT-STEPS.md (update current progress and next bug details)
- Amend commits to include documentation updates

## Phase 3 Planning Checklist

Before starting work on Subagent CRUD (Phase 3):

### Discovery & Planning
- [ ] Review Phase 3 requirements in this document
- [ ] Research YAML frontmatter parsing libraries
- [ ] Review existing parser implementation in backend
- [ ] Sketch UI mockups for create/edit forms
- [ ] Plan API endpoint design (POST/PUT/DELETE)
- [ ] Identify file system safety considerations

### Development Setup
- [ ] Pull latest changes: `git pull origin phase-2`
- [ ] Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/phase-3-crud`
- [ ] Verify Vite dev server runs on port 5173
- [ ] Verify backend server runs on port 8420

### Implementation Strategy
- [ ] Start with read-only form UI (state management)
- [ ] Add form validation for YAML frontmatter
- [ ] Implement POST endpoint for file creation
- [ ] Implement PUT endpoint for file updates
- [ ] Implement DELETE endpoint with safety checks
- [ ] Add file write permission verification
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite (50+ tests)
- [ ] Add error handling and user feedback

### Quality Gates
- [ ] All 583 existing tests still pass
- [ ] New tests for all CRUD operations pass
- [ ] Manual testing on port 5173 approved
- [ ] Zero console errors
- [ ] Documentation updated before commit
