## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
1. **Sidebar Scroll Behavior** (Story 3.3)
   - **Risk:** October 7 session spent 3+ hours debugging sidebar scrolling
   - **Mitigation:** Follow exact CSS structure from workflow analysis
   - **Test immediately:** After Task 3.3.1 completion

2. **Search Performance** (Story 3.4)
   - **Risk:** Slow search with large datasets (100+ items)
   - **Mitigation:** Debouncing (300ms), computed properties, efficient filtering

3. **Cross-Browser Compatibility** (Story 3.5)
   - **Risk:** CSS rendering issues on Safari
   - **Mitigation:** Test early, use CSS prefixes, avoid bleeding-edge features

### Medium Risk Items
1. **API Integration** - Cards depend on backend endpoints working correctly
2. **Theme Toggle** - Dark/light mode state management across components
3. **Responsive Design** - Layout complexity on smaller screens

### Low Risk Items
1. Copy-to-clipboard functionality (well-supported API)
2. Card component reusability
3. PrimeVue component integration

## Success Criteria

Epic 3 is successful when:

1. **✅ All Stories Complete:** Stories 3.1-3.5 delivered and merged
2. **✅ Automated Tests Passing:** 100% test suite green
3. **✅ Manual Testing Complete:** Cross-browser and responsive testing done
4. **✅ Performance Acceptable:** Meets performance budget
5. **✅ Accessibility Compliant:** WCAG AA standards met
6. **✅ User Acceptance:** Project manager approves demo
7. **✅ Documentation Updated:** CLAUDE.md and README.md current
8. **✅ Production Ready:** No known critical bugs

## Workflow Requirements

Per workflow analysis (docs/workflow-analysis-20251007.md):

### Feature Branch Workflow
- ✅ **One ticket = One branch = One PR** (always)
- ✅ **Feature branch naming:** `feature/story-3.x-description`
- ✅ **No direct commits to main** (enforced by pre-push hook)
- ✅ **PR required for all merges**

### Task Sizing
- ✅ **All tasks 30-60 minutes maximum**
- ✅ **Tasks independently testable**
- ✅ **Tasks independently committable**
- ⚠️ **Break down any task > 1 hour** into sub-tasks

### Commit Frequency
- ✅ **Commit every 15-30 minutes** of productive work
- ✅ **One commit per task** (after testing passes)
- ✅ **Descriptive commit messages** (conventional commits format)

### Testing Discipline
- ✅ **Test immediately** after each task implementation
- ✅ **Automated tests mandatory** before PR creation (quality gate)
- ✅ **Test failure blocks PR** (hard requirement)
- ✅ **Manual sanity check** during development

### Git Workflow Sequence (Per Story)
1. git-workflow-specialist creates feature branch
2. frontend-developer implements tasks (one at a time)
3. Developer tests each task immediately (manual sanity check)
4. git-workflow-specialist commits after each task (15-30 min intervals)
5. After all tasks complete → test-automation-engineer runs Playwright tests
6. If tests PASS → documentation-engineer updates docs
7. code-reviewer reviews code + test results
8. git-workflow-specialist creates PR (only if tests passed)
9. After PR approval → git-workflow-specialist merges

## Notes

### Lessons from October 7 Session
Per workflow analysis, avoid these anti-patterns:
- ❌ **No "big bang" development** - implement entire subsystems at once
- ❌ **No late testing** - test only after features "complete"
- ❌ **No working on main** - always use feature branches
- ❌ **No infrequent commits** - commit every 15-30 min, not every 3 hours

### Parallel Work Opportunities
After Story 3.2 completes:
- **Option A:** Story 3.3 (Interactive) and Story 3.4 (Search) can run in parallel
- **Option B:** Complete Story 3.3 first (sidebar), then Story 3.4 (search)
- **Recommendation:** Sequential (3.3 → 3.4) safer for single developer

### User Checkpoints
Request user review after each story completion:
- After Story 3.2: Review configuration cards display
- After Story 3.3: Review interactive features (sidebar, expand/collapse)
- After Story 3.4: Review search/filter functionality
- After Story 3.5: Final review before Phase 1 MVP release

## Next Steps

1. **User selects ticket(s)** from Stories 3.2-3.5
2. **Orchestrator delegates to git-workflow-specialist** - create feature branch
3. **Frontend-developer implements** selected tasks (one at a time)
4. **Test-automation-engineer runs tests** (mandatory quality gate)
5. **Git-workflow-specialist creates PR** (only if tests pass)
6. **User reviews and merges** PR
7. **Repeat** for next ticket

**Ready to begin Story 3.2!**
