# TASK-1.1.2: Design Project List Layout Mockup

**Epic:** EPIC-1
**Story:** Story 1.1 - Dashboard & Project List Wireframes
**Status:** Pending
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Assigned To:** wireframe-designer
**Dependencies:** TASK-1.1.1

## Description

Create wireframe mockup showing the project list/grid layout on the dashboard. Include all key elements: project cards, search bar, filter controls, and rescan button.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Wireframe shows project grid/list layout
- [ ] Project name and path clearly visible
- [ ] Configuration counts displayed (agents, commands, hooks, MCP)
- [ ] Search bar placement defined
- [ ] Filter controls placement defined
- [ ] Rescan button placement defined
- [ ] Responsive behavior notes included

## Implementation Notes

Elements to include:
- Project name (prominent)
- Project path (subdued)
- Configuration type counts (badges/pills)
- Missing project indicator (if project path invalid)
- Search bar (top of list)
- Filter controls (by config type, status)
- Rescan button (refresh project list)

Layout considerations:
- Grid vs list view
- Card spacing and sizing
- Mobile responsive stacking
