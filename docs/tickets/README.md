### EPIC-3: Frontend Development ⏳
**Status:** IN PROGRESS (0% - awaiting ticket creation)
**Tasks:** TBD (to be generated by project-manager)
**Location:** `epic-3-frontend/`

Next phase: Build Vue 3 frontend with project detail view, configuration cards, and user/global views.

**Planned Stories:**

- Story 3.2: Configuration Cards Layout
- Story 3.3: Detail Sidebar/Panel
- Story 3.4: User/Global Configuration View
- Story 3.5: Integration & Testing

---

## Current Next Steps

1. **Invoke project-manager** to review EPIC-3 requirements and generate detailed tickets
2. **Start EPIC-3 Story 3.1** (Project Detail View Structure)
3. **Follow ticket-based workflow** (one ticket at a time, with testing)

---

## Ticket Naming Convention

```
EPIC-[number].md              # Epic overview
TASK-[epic].[story].[task].md # Individual tasks
BUG-[number]-description.md   # Bug tracking
```

**Examples:**
- `EPIC-3.md` - Frontend Development epic overview
- `TASK-3.1.1.md` - First task in Story 3.1
- `BUG-001-user-agents-yaml-parsing.md` - Bug fix ticket

---

## Ticket Workflow

1. **Project Manager** creates Epic and generates all tasks
2. **Git-workflow-specialist** creates feature branch (`feature/TASK-X.X.X-description`)
3. **Developer** implements feature + tests immediately
4. **Test-automation-engineer** runs automated tests
5. **Code-reviewer** reviews implementation and test results
6. **Git-workflow-specialist** commits, creates PR, and merges after approval

## Archive Policy

Obsolete or superseded tickets are moved to `_archived/` with descriptive names:
- Old epic files replaced by new structure
- Duplicate or outdated planning documents
- Superseded task definitions

Active tickets are never archived - they remain in their epic folders as historical record.
