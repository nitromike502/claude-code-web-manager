# TASK-1.3.1: Choose Detail View Interaction Pattern

**Epic:** EPIC-1
**Story:** Story 1.3 - Configuration Detail Interaction Wireframes
**Status:** Pending
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Assigned To:** wireframe-designer
**Dependencies:** TASK-1.2.3

## Description

Make a key architectural decision: how should users view full details of a configuration item (agent, command, hook, MCP server)? Evaluate modal, inline expansion, and separate page approaches.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Three approaches evaluated (modal, inline, separate page)
- [ ] Pros and cons documented for each
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness considered
- [ ] Decision made with clear rationale
- [ ] Decision documented for frontend team

## Implementation Notes

**Option 1: Modal Dialog**
- Pros: Stays on same page, overlay focus, easy to close
- Cons: Limited space for long content, may feel cramped

**Option 2: Inline Expansion**
- Pros: Contextual, no navigation, smooth animation
- Cons: Pushes other content down, may be disorienting

**Option 3: Separate Page/Route**
- Pros: Full space for content, shareable URL, browser back button works
- Cons: Feels like more navigation, need to return to list

**Recommendation criteria:**
- Content length (agents have long system prompts)
- Mobile experience
- User workflow (viewing multiple items)
- PrimeVue component availability

**PRD guidance:**
- PRD mentions "click to view full details" but doesn't specify pattern
- Mobile responsiveness is required
- Read-only in Phase 1 (no editing forms)
