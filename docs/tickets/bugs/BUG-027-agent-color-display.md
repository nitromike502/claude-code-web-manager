## Description
Agent configuration sidebar detail view is not displaying the `color` field from agent YAML frontmatter, even though the field is parsed and available.

## Current Behavior
- Agent sidebar shows name, description, and allowed tools
- The `color` field is parsed from YAML but not displayed
- Users cannot see what color the agent is configured to use

## Expected Behavior
- Agent detail sidebar should display the color field
- Color field should be clearly labeled and readable
- Should handle missing color gracefully

## Affected Component(s)
- ProjectDetail.vue (agent sidebar metadata section)
- UserGlobal.vue (agent sidebar metadata section)

## Data Source
- Agent YAML frontmatter: `color` field
- Example: `color: blue`, `color: cyan`

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to any project detail page or user global config
2. Scroll to agents section
3. Click on an agent card to open sidebar
4. Observe that color field is NOT displayed in metadata section
5. Verify the agent YAML has a color field

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Agent sidebar detail view displays color field
- [x] Color field is clearly labeled
- [x] Color value is shown in readable format
- [x] Handles missing color gracefully (shows "Not specified" if not set)
- [x] Works in both ProjectDetail.vue and UserGlobal.vue

## Resolution
**Fixed in commit `253461c`**

### Changes Made
1. **ProjectDetail.vue (line 271):** Added color field display to agent metadata section
2. **UserGlobal.vue (line 254):** Added color field display to agent metadata section
3. Both components display color value or "Not specified" as fallback

### Tests Added
- [Test 04.004.001] Agent color displays in ProjectDetail sidebar [BUG-027]
- [Test 04.004.002] Agent color displays in UserGlobal sidebar [BUG-027]
- All tests passing (17/17 in file 04-component-rendering.spec.js)

### Additional Fix
- **BUG-029 (bonus):** Agent tools field also now displays in sidebar metadata for both components

### Verification
- ✅ Manual testing on Vite dev server (port 5173) approved by user
- ✅ Playwright E2E tests passing
- ✅ All 270+ backend Jest tests passing
- ✅ Code committed and pushed to origin/phase-2
