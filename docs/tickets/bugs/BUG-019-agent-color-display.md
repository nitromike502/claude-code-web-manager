## Description
Agent configuration cards are not displaying the `color` field from the agent YAML frontmatter, and the color indicator (if implemented) is not showing the agent's configured color.

## Current Behavior
- Agent cards show generic or default coloring
- The `color` field from YAML frontmatter is parsed but not displayed
- No visual indicator of which color the agent is configured to use

## Expected Behavior
- Agent cards should display or be styled with the agent's configured color
- Sidebar should show the color configuration explicitly
- Color selector/indicator should be visually prominent

## Affected Component(s)
- AgentCard.vue
- DetailSidebar.vue (when showing agent details)

## Data Source
- Agent YAML frontmatter: `color` field
- Example: `color: blue` or similar

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to any project detail page
2. Scroll to agents section
3. Check if agent cards show/use the configured color
4. Click on an agent to open sidebar
5. Verify color field is displayed in detail view

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Agent cards visually represent the agent's color (background, border, or icon)
- [ ] Sidebar detail view explicitly shows color configuration
- [ ] Color field is readable and clear
- [ ] Handles missing color configuration gracefully
