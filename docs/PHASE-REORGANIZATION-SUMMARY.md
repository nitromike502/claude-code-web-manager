# Phase Reorganization Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Rationale:** Insert new Phase 2 (Vite+Vue3 SPA Migration) as technical foundation before Phase 3+ CRUD operations

## What Changed

### Phase Numbering Shift

| Old | New | Description |
|-----|-----|-------------|
| Phase 1 | Phase 1 | ✅ MVP (View-Only) - **NO CHANGE** |
| Phase 2 (Subagents) | Phase 3 | Edit Subagent Operations |
| Phase 2 (Commands) | Phase 4 | Create/Edit/Delete Slash Commands |
| Phase 2 (Hooks) | Phase 5 | Create/Edit/Delete Hooks |
| Phase 2 (MCP) | Phase 6 | Create/Edit/Delete MCP Servers |
| **NEW** | **Phase 2** | **Vite+Vue3 SPA Migration (Technical Foundation)** |

### File Reorganization

## Why This Change?

### The Problem with Current Architecture
1. **Page reloads** - Navigation reloads entire app (Phase 2+ edit features need smooth state management)
2. **Hybrid approach** - Multiple HTML files with separate Vue instances (difficult to maintain)
3. **No SPA routing** - Manual event-driven navigation (fragile)
4. **Limited state management** - Hard to track edit state across components
5. **Developer experience** - No HMR, no Vue DevTools, manual bundling

### Why Phase 2 Must Be the Migration
1. **Foundation required** - Phase 3+ edit features depend on Vite SPA architecture
2. **Technical debt** - Current setup won't scale with CRUD operations
3. **Zero feature impact** - Migration preserves all Phase 1 functionality
4. **Clean timing** - Phase 1 complete, before major feature work
5. **Team velocity** - Better dev experience = faster iteration on Phases 3+

## Phase 2: Vite+Vue3 SPA Migration Details

### 8 Stories, 40+ Tasks (~12 hours total)

1. **Story 2.1:** Vite Setup & Project Structure (2h)
2. **Story 2.2:** Vue Router Setup (1.5h)
3. **Story 2.3:** Pinia State Management (1.5h)
4. **Story 2.4:** Convert Components to .vue Format (3.5h)
5. **Story 2.5:** API Integration & Data Flow (1.5h)
6. **Story 2.6:** Styling & CSS Variables (1.5h)
7. **Story 2.7:** Testing & Migration Validation (2h)
8. **Story 2.8:** Documentation & Cleanup (1h)

### Branching Strategy for Phase 2

```
phase-2 (base branch for all Phase 2 work)
├── feature/vite-setup (Story 2.1) → PR → merge to phase-2
├── feature/vue-router (Story 2.2) → PR → merge to phase-2
├── feature/pinia-stores (Story 2.3) → PR → merge to phase-2
├── feature/component-conversion (Story 2.4) → PR → merge to phase-2
├── feature/api-integration (Story 2.5) → PR → merge to phase-2
├── feature/styling-css (Story 2.6) → PR → merge to phase-2
├── feature/testing-validation (Story 2.7) → PR → merge to phase-2
└── feature/documentation (Story 2.8) → PR → merge to phase-2

After all complete:
phase-2 → main (fast-forward merge)
```

## Success Criteria for Phase 2

### Functionality
- ✅ 100% Phase 1 feature parity (no regressions)
- ✅ Client-side routing (no page reloads)
- ✅ Smooth component transitions
- ✅ Global state management working

### Performance
- ✅ Bundle size < 500KB (gzipped)
- ✅ Initial load < 2 seconds
- ✅ HMR updates < 1 second

### Code Quality
- ✅ All Playwright tests pass (100%)
- ✅ Zero console errors/warnings
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- ✅ Code review approved

---

## Timeline

- **Phase 2:** 2-3 development sessions (~12 hours total)
- **Phase 3 (Subagents):** Ready immediately after Phase 2 complete
- **Phases 4-6:** Can proceed sequentially or in parallel

---

## Impact on Teams

### What Stays the Same
- Phase 1 functionality (read-only viewing)
- Backend API (no changes)
- User interface (visual design unchanged)

### What Improves
- **Developer Experience:** HMR, Vue DevTools, better debugging
- **Performance:** Optimized bundle, faster navigation
- **Maintainability:** Proper SPA structure, clear state management
- **Scalability:** Foundation for all CRUD operations
- **Testing:** Cleaner test selectors, better component isolation
